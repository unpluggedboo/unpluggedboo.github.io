<h1>The Bombshell and The Man 📖</h1>

It was a warm August Friday night in Osterville, Massachusetts. The Man and his friend Fox arrived at Kirbyonce’s house, greeted by her mom and dog Boston. They headed upstairs, briefly saying hello to the group as everyone got ready for the night out.

During the drive down, Fox had mentioned a girl the Man might like, someone special. But it wasn’t until he rejoined the group in Kirbyonce’s room, after getting dressed, that he saw her for the first time. The Bombshell. Long blonde hair, elegant cheekbones, and a warm, effortless smile. He felt drawn to her immediately.

The group migrated to the kitchen where Mrs. Kirbyonce was making dinner. Sitting on the stools, the Man and the Bombshell had their first real conversation: college, work, the usual small talk, but with a spark underneath it. Call it mild flirting. They were both testing the waters. The rest of the pregame filled itself with music, dancing, games, and photos.

Two Ubers were called, and it seemed harmless that they ended up in different cars, but it nearly derailed fate. The cars went to two different bars. The Man’s group grabbed drinks and settled in. After a while, Ari, someone he had met earlier that summer, asked him directly if he liked the Bombshell. Caught off guard, he paused, then smiled and admitted he did. He said he’d handle it. Ari double-checked if he was sure. He was.

About 40 minutes later, they made their way to the other bar. The Man went straight to find her. She was at the bar, they caught up, grabbed drinks, and headed to the dance floor. That’s when everything else started to fade into the background. With her in front of him, the world felt smaller and brighter at the same time. Her charisma was genuine, her eyes captivating, her wit disarming.

She taught him the basics of hip-hop dancing, how to find rhythm in his chest, how to move without overthinking. She made him feel confident, laughing with him as he upgraded from “baby deer” to “respectable middle-schooler” level dancing (he now claims expert status). When she stepped away briefly to check in with friends, the pull between them only grew stronger. She came back and kissed him. He gently pulled her back and said, “That can’t be our first kiss.” She laughed, held his gaze, and said, “Follow me.”

The night unfolded the way you might expect, but what stood out were the unexpected moments. Small complications handled with kindness. Little reassurances. The beginnings of a space that felt safe and steady already, a space they’ve continued building together ever since.

The next day could have faded into a typical weekend fling: breakfast with friends, poolside flirting, easy goodbyes. But when the Bombshell left to bring her friends home, she told him they should meet up again that night: get the group together, go out again, that type of thing. He knew then he would see her, no matter what the rest of the plan was. The day flew by, boating, drinks, dinner, until he had a choice: stay with the group or go see her. As Mrs. Kirbyonce would say, “Strike while the iron’s hot.” He chose her.

An hour-long Uber stood between them. After a brief hiccup, her talking with a guy at the bar right as he arrived, the night turned perfect again. Stargazing at the old ops house. A chaotic, laughter-filled Uber ride. Mess-free games. Long late-night talks.

This is usually where stories slow down. Where people say to play it cool and drag out the chase. But the Man thought: when a connection feels this real, why act distant? There was no chase. He was already hers.

An Instagram may or may not have been created. A Spotify playlist too, possibly. Then came the dates: drinks with the parents that turned into French dinners, Red Sox games, nights out with friends, Bombshell arts-and-craft deliveries, Patriots tickets, and a certain Manchester story that may or may not have reached the press.

Eventually, they found themselves in the basement of Capo, the Paris of Southie, surrounded by many of the same people who were there the night they met. A little tipsy, a lot happy. The Bombshell grabbed him and said, “Just ask me out. I know you want to.” He pulled her aside and asked, “Are you sure?” She looked at him with calm certainty, the kind that said she’d known his answer since August.

Since then, their love has only grown. Their worlds have intertwined more each day. The Man does everything he can to show her what she means to him, not from fear of losing her, but from the simple truth of how deeply he loves her. He has never felt more understood or more fully seen than he does with her.

Her honesty has always been steady and sincere, never guarded, never half-there, the kind of openness that makes love feel grounded and real. She’s done the hard, meaningful work of helping build a relationship where both of them can be completely unfiltered, completely themselves. And choosing each other fully, even in that raw honesty, that’s what makes their love different. That’s what makes it true.

Avery, I can’t imagine these past months without you. I am completely and utterly in love with who you are and everything you bring into my life. This story doesn’t need an ending… 

Yours,
Lars
